## **Title**  
Impact of Early School Leaving on the Unemployment and Criminality Rates in the Federal States of Germany in 2022  

## **Main Question**  
Does the early school leaving influence the unemployment and criminality rates in the different federal states in Germany?  

## **Description**  
Addressing the relationship between early school leaving and the unemployment rate, as well as criminality rate, in the German federal states helps to evaluate the critical economical and social implications of early school dropping and urges the policy makers to take the necessary measures to guarantee an effective learning curriculum that reduces the number of pupils, who leave school at an early age. Besides, this project aims at promoting interventions to warn pupils about the drawbacks of early school dropping and hopes to reduce the risk of delinquency among the early school leavers.

## **Title**  
Impact of Early School Leaving on the Unemployment and Criminality Rates in the Federal States of Germany in 2022  

## **Main Question**  
Does the early school leaving influence the unemployment and criminality rates in the different federal states in Germany?  

## **Description**  
Addressing the relationship between early school leaving and the unemployment rate, as well as the criminality rate, in the German federal states, helps to evaluate the critical economic and social implications of early school dropping and urges the policymakers to take the necessary measures to guarantee an effective learning curriculum that reduces the number of pupils who leave school at an early age. In addition, this project aims to promote interventions to warn students of the disadvantages of dropping out of school and hopes to reduce the risk of delinquency among early school leavers.
